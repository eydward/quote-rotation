TL;DR uses `requests` with Discord API v10. Also uses `notify-py` library to push desktop notifications whenever run (with some indication of success/failure). Shellscript offers compatibility with miniconda environments and works with crontab.

## gnome top bar
TL;DR is a GNOME extension, closely modeled after some simple GNOME extensions one may find on the web.
